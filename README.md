`Reference Card`

This is an ANSI 104 keyboard layout for Windows/Linux/OSX which retains the standard US layout mapping but adds a large number of new symbols and diacritics. Unlike the US International layout this does not replace any of the open keys from the standard US layout to make it easier for those who dislike how different the US International layout is or simply want to retain their open key mappings for ease of use. It also uses alphabetic keys exclusively for alphabetic characters when combined with Alt-Gr and expands the number of single-stroke accented characters that can be typed to make it easier to reduce reliance on dead keys. New characters have been regrouped compared to US International to make them easier to find.
